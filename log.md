#100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 2 - December 29, 2022

### Today's Progress:
- focus today was on the ZTM "CSS and Advanced CSS: The Complete Developer's Guide" course
- Walked through and refresh on the basics on CSS: 
  > Selector, Properties, how to use IMG and text/fonts elements, Box Model, px vs rem vs rem

### Thoughts:
- So far, everything sticks pretty well. The only thing is that there are so many selector and attributes out there needed to be learned.
- My biggest weakness right now with CSS is understanding how "parents, child" correlate with each other.

### Link to Work:
- not going to bother pushing the project work from the course out to GitHub.  I'll reserve that for when I make something unique that leverages what I've learned.

# Day 3 - December 30, 2022

## Today's Progress:
  (The Complete Developer's Guide" course)
  -✅Flexbox
  -✅CSS Transitions and Transforms
  
### __What are the advantages of using flex ?__ 
    > The reason why you would want to use flexbox is to *lay out the collection of items in one direction or another*. when you lay out the items, you might want to use flexbox to control the spacing between the items, as well as the dimension of the items. 
  
### __What are the pros and cons of flexbox ?__
    -Elements can be compressed and stretched according to specified rules, occupying the necessary space.
    -Aligning vertically and horizontally, the baseline of the text works great.
    -The location of elements in html is not critical. It can be changed in CSS. This is especially important for some aspects of responsive layout.
    -Elements can be automatically lined up in several rows / columns, taking up all the space provided.
    -Many languages in the world use right-to-left spelling rtl (right-to-left), in contrast to the usual ltr (left-to-right). Flexbox is adapted for this. It has a concept of beginning and end, not right and left. Those. in browsers with the rtl locale, all elements will be automatically arranged in reverse order.
    -The syntax of CSS rules is very simple and is learned quite quickly.


### Thoughts:
- [x] Practice css selector
- Why use Flexbox over other layout methods like Grid?
