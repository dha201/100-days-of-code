#100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 2 - December 29, 2022

### Today's Progress:
- focus today was on the ZTM "CSS and Advanced CSS: The Complete Developer's Guide" course
- Walked through and refresh on the basics on CSS: 
  > Selector, Properties, how to use IMG and text/fonts elements, Box Model, px vs rem vs rem

### Thoughts:
- So far, everything sticks pretty well. The only thing is that there are so many selector and attributes out there needed to be learned.
- My biggest weakness right now with CSS is understanding how "parents, child" correlate with each other.

### Link to Work:
- not going to bother pushing the project work from the course out to GitHub.  I'll reserve that for when I make something unique that leverages what I've learned.

# Day 3 - December 30, 2022

## Today's Progress:
  (The Complete Developer's Guide" course)<br>
  ✅Flexbox<br>
  ✅CSS Transitions and Transforms<br>
  
### __What are the advantages of using flex ?__ 
    > The reason why you would want to use flexbox is to *lay out the collection of items in one direction or another*. when you lay out the items, you might want to use flexbox to control the spacing between the items, as well as the dimension of the items. 
  
### __What are the pros and cons of flexbox ?__
    -Elements can be compressed and stretched according to specified rules, occupying the necessary space.
    -Aligning vertically and horizontally, the baseline of the text works great.
    -The location of elements in html is not critical. It can be changed in CSS. This is especially important for some aspects of responsive layout.
    -Elements can be automatically lined up in several rows / columns, taking up all the space provided.
    -Many languages in the world use right-to-left spelling rtl (right-to-left), in contrast to the usual ltr (left-to-right). Flexbox is adapted for this. It has a concept of beginning and end, not right and left. Those. in browsers with the rtl locale, all elements will be automatically arranged in reverse order.
    -The syntax of CSS rules is very simple and is learned quite quickly.


### Thoughts:
- [x] Practice css selector
- Why use Flexbox over other layout methods like Grid?

# Day 4 - January 4, 2023

## Today's Progress:
  (The Complete Developer's Guide" course)<br>
  ✅Bootstrap + exercise (Start-Up page) <br>
  ✅Bootstrap Grid <br>
  ✅How to create an email campaign landing page w/ Mailchimp
  ✅How to publish your website online w/ Github
### Thoughts:
- So far, Bootstrap seems like a very useful library, especially for creating a website in a timely manner. There are a lot of tools and utilities in there that I was able to test around in the project like Grid, Flex, Button and special hover before and after effects. However, tbh I still had a difficult time with figuring out how to align all the contents. I'm not sure if this was due to me missing some part from the tutorial or the new updated version of Bootstrap requires different methods to align some elements like a line breaker. Which, I had to include some extra utilities and element that wasn't a part of the tutorial. Otherwise, everything went pretty smoothly, I was able to add some additional features, but nothing to brag about.
