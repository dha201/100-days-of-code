#100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 2 - December 29, 2022

### Today's Progress:
- focus today was on the ZTM "CSS and Advanced CSS: The Complete Developer's Guide" course
- Walked through and refresh on the basics on CSS: 
  > Selector, Properties, how to use IMG and text/fonts elements, Box Model, px vs rem vs rem

### Thoughts:
- So far, everything sticks pretty well. The only thing is that there are so many selector and attributes out there needed to be learned.
- My biggest weakness right now with CSS is understanding how "parents, child" correlate with each other.

### Link to Work:
- not going to bother pushing the project work from the course out to GitHub.  I'll reserve that for when I make something unique that leverages what I've learned.
